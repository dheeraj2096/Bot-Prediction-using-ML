Bot Prediction using Twitter API:
We collect the information of the bots and store them in a csv file. 
You need to put in your API details.
We compare the tweet count of users vs bots in bar plot and linear regression plot.
We train the Gaussian Naive Bayes and Decision Tree models and predict the results.
